details: 'City Guerilla is a creative laboratory which rests on the following principles: self-organized youth, their creative association, peer education and alternative education, exchanging a wide range of skills, knowledge and ideas. These young people have different educational backgrounds, interests, talents, abilities, life experience and attitudes. The synergy of these versatile factors forms specific creative spaces for applying various ideas in the fields of art and social activism with an aim to inspire young people to take an active part in shaping their own urban environment and strengthen civil society.

City Guerilla originates from a project developed by the Goethe-Institut entitled Goethe-Guerilla, which started in 2010 with the aim to connect with young people. During seven years of the project (both as Goethe and City Guerilla), more than 150 young people from Belgrade and the region have been given an opportunity to realize their ideas and gain experience in self-organization process by implementing projects on the topic they have chosen themselves: the Right to the City – improving our own urban environment.

From 2010 until today there have been many exhibitions, installations, workshops (in collaboration with local and international artists), debates, lectures, concerts, participative and environmental public space interventions, research projects, regional and international events and workshops, including two international meetings supported by the European Union program entitled “Youth in Action”. Within the framework of the international project of the Goethe-Institut "ACTOPOLIS. The Art of Action", City Guerilla was one of the 14 participants of the Belgrade edition of Actopolis called "Formally Informal" curated by Mirjana Boba Stojadinović.

Once a controversial name, Goethe-Guerilla (Goethe = an institution, Guerilla = freedom of action), which strongly depicts the singularity of this symbiosis during the organic process of self-organization of a group of young people on their way to independence under the roof of a cultural institution, has in the meantime, among young people, become a synonym for team work, creativity, open access, exchange of knowledge and ideas in the fields of art and social activism both on local and international levels. Since 2012 members of Goethe-Guerilla have been focused on the run-down neighborhood of Savamala. They have been monitoring, investigating and documenting its dramatic architectural transformation and have either taken an active part in it or opposed it through their projects and actions. In March 2013 the Goethe-Insititut officially launches the project "Urban Incubator: Belgrade" in Savamala. Soon after, Goethe-Guerilla joines other local and international projects from the previous generations (2010-2014), decides to become independent founding an association named City Guerilla, which continues its activities supported the Goethe-Institut, now as a partner.

Since 2010 until today, members of Goethe/City Guerilla have, in cooperation with the Goethe-Institut, realized more than 200 small and large scale projects and actions in Serbia and abroad, thus establishing a wide cooperation network with similar initiatives in the country and the region. '

### Shade-grown coffee
Coffee is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest understory in its wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees that provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.

### Single origin
Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever degree available.

### Sustainable farming
Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

### Direct sourcing
Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits
We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. That’s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
