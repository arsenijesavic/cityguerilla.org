  City Guerilla is a creative laboratory which rests on the following
  principles: self-organized youth, their creative association, peer education
  and alternative education, exchanging a wide range of skills, knowledge and
  ideas. These young people have different educational backgrounds, interests,
  talents, abilities, life experience and attitudes. The synergy of these
  versatile factors forms specific creative spaces for applying various ideas in
  the fields of art and social activism with an aim to inspire young people to
  take an active part in shaping their own urban environment and strengthen
  civil society.

  City Guerilla originates from a project developed by the Goethe-Institut
  entitled Goethe-Guerilla, which started in 2010 with the aim to connect with
  young people. During seven years of the project (both as Goethe and City
  Guerilla), more than 150 young people from Belgrade and the region have been
  given an opportunity to realize their ideas and gain experience in
  self-organization process by implementing projects on the topic they have
  chosen themselves: the Right to the City – improving our own urban
  environment.

  From 2010 until today there have been many exhibitions, installations,
  workshops (in collaboration with local and international artists), debates,
  lectures, concerts, participative and environmental public space
  interventions, research projects, regional and international events and
  workshops, including two international meetings supported by the European
  Union program entitled “Youth in Action”. Within the framework of the
  international project of the Goethe-Institut "ACTOPOLIS. The Art of Action",
  City Guerilla was one of the 14 participants of the Belgrade edition of
  Actopolis called "Formally Informal" curated by Mirjana Boba Stojadinović.

  Once a controversial name, Goethe-Guerilla (Goethe = an institution, Guerilla
  = freedom of action), which strongly depicts the singularity of this symbiosis
  during the organic process of self-organization of a group of young people on
  their way to independence under the roof of a cultural institution, has in the
  meantime, among young people, become a synonym for team work, creativity, open
  access, exchange of knowledge and ideas in the fields of art and social
  activism both on local and international levels. Since 2012 members of
  Goethe-Guerilla have been focused on the run-down neighborhood of Savamala.
  They have been monitoring, investigating and documenting its dramatic
  architectural transformation and have either taken an active part in it or
  opposed it through their projects and actions. In March 2013 the
  Goethe-Insititut officially launches the project "Urban Incubator: Belgrade"
  in Savamala. Soon after, Goethe-Guerilla joines other local and international
  projects from the previous generations (2010-2014), decides to become
  independent founding an association named City Guerilla, which continues its
  activities supported the Goethe-Institut, now as a partner.

  Since 2010 until today, members of Goethe/City Guerilla have, in cooperation
  with the Goethe-Institut, realized more than 200 small and large scale
  projects and actions in Serbia and abroad, thus establishing a wide
  cooperation network with similar initiatives in the country and the region.
