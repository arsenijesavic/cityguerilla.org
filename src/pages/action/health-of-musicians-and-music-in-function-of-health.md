  description: "Music and health were two key words of this project of Goethe-Guerilla and Goethe-Institut. Namely, the Institute for Musicans’ Health Kurt Zinger from Berlin, presented itself on 3 June in the hall of the Goethe-Institut with its lecture entitled “Health of musicians and music in function of health“. The aim of the Kurt Zinger Institute is research, development and testing measures for illness prevention when it comes to musicians, as well as finding treatments.\nThe title of the lecture implies a distinction between musical treatments and musicans’ treatments. However, in accordance with the goal of this Berlin based Institute – the emphasis on taking care of musicans’ health – a large part of this lecture was devoted to mental training and training when it comes to musicans’ performances. In this case, another perspective was shown regarding treatments and elimination of ailments in musicians, but this time „without music“.\n \nProfessor Kristin Gutenberg was born in 1972 in Tegernsee.
