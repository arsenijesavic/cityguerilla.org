  description: "Synapsys is an interactive audio-visual installation which aims to represent the problem of pain perception as an information by directly interacting with the visitors. The entire audio-visual content is produced in real time and no experience of this interactive work is identical. The idea behind this installation is that pain is just a mere information induced by outer or inner factors deemed dangerous, and the reciprocal information coming from the brain via neurons and synapses is an unpleasant feeling, i.e. pain.\nTechnically speaking, the installation consists of two computers, one of which is directly connected to the speakers and serves as the means of generating audio content for the installation. The other computer is connected to a Microsoft’s Xbox Kinect sensor and a projector displaying generated visual content. The sensor provides coordinates of an observer who interacts with the installation. That is how the constantly changing video content is generated. The audio content is also created through two computers in constant communication, exchanging information via the sensor.\nProduced audio-visual content can be divided into three stages. The first one is the painless sleep mode in which a small green ball, defined by a network of lines, pulses in synchronization with the accompanying sound resembling a calm heartbeat.\nWhen an observer comes closer to the projection and when the sensor detects him, this marks the beginning of the second phase, which aims to awaken a sense of tension within the observer. The ball, depending on the proximity of the observer, grows, and changes color from green to yellow according to the gradient basis. It slowly begins to deform in shape by mild organic undulation of its volume. The audio content constantly in sync with the visuals also changes, adding new sounds that accompany the agitated state. The third stage is a condition of pain in which the ball’s form completely loses its structure, organic pulsations of volume become geometric and sharp, its lines become bright red, and it fills in the entire defined digital space in size. The sound gets amplified and intense. The entire synesthesia is transmitted to the observer as a state of pain and discomfort which he or she can easily get out from, if they step back from the projection in a short period of time.\nThe objective of Synapsys is to represent the problem of pain perception and stages of pain through an interactive installation which consists of audio-visual data, the content of which depends on the participant himself.\nThis installation was first shown during the one-day presentation of the CG PULS module on 5 December 2015 in Magacin, 4 Kraljevića Marka in Savamala.\nFrom 22 to 24 September 2016, the audiovisual interactive installation \"Synapsis\" was presented at the Močvara Gallery in Zagreb (Croatia) and a workshop was held under the leadership of artist Stanislav Drča (a member of the City Guerilla) and visual artist Rodrigo Guzman Cásares on the topic of VVVV, a multimedia platform used for creating the “Synapsis” installation. The same year in March “Synapsis” was presented at La Casa Amarilla in Malaga, Spain, where Stanislav Drča held a workshop on interactive art and video-mapping. “Synapsis” was also presented at the large international exhibition of the Goethe-Institut entitled “Actopolis. The Art of Action\" held from 25 April to 20 May 2017 at the City Museum of Belgrade."
