  description: "Every city has a unique set of sounds, forming a characteristic audio landscape. The Guerilla has devoted itself to investigating these sounds, in order to showcase Savamala through that landscape. The focus of PULS is to create an experience of a city through sound, visualisation, performance and installation. This project of a synesthetic character which amplifies the sensual experience of the city, aims at describing the specific perception of the urban environment.\nThe PULS of Savamala project concentrates around the sounds collected from that city quarter. The Guerilla combined two types of microphones. One was a DIY contact microphone used to collect micro sounds from vibrations, for example the sound of the Branko bridge. The other was a stereo recorder collecting sounds that describe the general atmosphere of Savamala, for instance the sound of the river. The Goethe-Guerilla has collected over 40 hours of different audio material. Selected sounds are available online, on soundcloud and tumblr web pages.\nThe PULS of Savamala project consists of three parts that represent the past, present and future of Savamala.\nThe past is shown through the Lightboom, an audiovisual installation. The Lightbooms themselves are a patent of the Goethe- Guerilla and is a DIY projector, made from second-hand parts, light and easy to move, projecting images without cables. Operating on batteries and small light bulbs, the lightboom consists of mirrors and lenses, and the image is projected via photo negatives or transparent paper.\nThe idea of the Lightboom installation is to metaphorically express the memories of the Savamala locals. In this installation the sounds consists of inserts from interviews collected during the year. Each sequence, depending on the way it is played, has a different meaning. Using the Arduino, which controls the installation with a code, the dynamics and changing of a city is displayed.\nThe Savamala Postboxes are the second part of the project and represent the present, using the interaction between the participant and the audiovisual elements of the installation. When a visitor opens a postbox, he plays one of twelve sounds that interact. At the same time, an image is projected at the bottom of the postbox.\nThe Spanish House Installation is the third part and relates to the future of Savamala. The Spanish House will go through some drastic changes. Due to the current events regarding the Belgrade on Water mega investment project, it will be given to an investor and transformed into a hotel. The Goethe- Guerilla have been using this space as an instrument and a unique temple of Savamala. Because of its importance and symbolic meaning, not only for the Goethe- Guerilla, but for the whole Savamala, the Spanish House is the best space that could describe the future of Savamala.\nIn November, this space was for the last time used as a gallery before it will have forever been changed. In order to describe this future development, the space was completely deconstructed and changed. From the current Spanish House, only a 25m hallway was left that leads to a new, unknown and dim surrounding, which symbolizes the vague future of this building.\n \n \nMitOst Festival in Novi Sad – Puls Workshop\n \n2014,  in early October, the Goethe-Guerilla tried to for the first time, with the experience gathered from the PULS of Savamala project, to describe the PULS of Novi Sad. At the/invited by MitOst Festival in Novi Sad, they organized a three-day workshop in order to demonstrate the basic principles of the PULS of Savamala project. The main goal of the workshop was to briefly introduce the methodology and starting point,  from preparation, recording, processing evaluation and contextualization of specific sounds, as well as introducing basic methods of creating visualizations based on the gathered sounds.\nSpecial emphasis was put on building DIY contact microphones and Lightbooms."
