  description: "The 55. Book fair in Belgrade saw an interactive Franziska Wike's exhibition about the usage of German words in the Serbian language as well as a series of interviews with various visitors of the fair. By participating in this exhibition, Goethe-Guerilla managed to make a direct link between Serbian and German culture. In addition, inspired by this action, a competition entitled “The most beautiful Serbian word of German origin” was held. We received a large number of entries, some even with explanations better than the words themselves. The competition winners were the following words: gepek (Gepäck; car trunk), licitar (Lebzetler; a type of decorated candy), ringišpil (Ringispiel; carousel), gelipter (Geliebter; playboy), kibicfenster (Kiebitzfenster; lapwing window),), špajz (Speisekammer; pantry), štrudla (Strudel; strudel), šalter (Schalter; counter)."
