  description: "Public space as a platform for communication and ways of reaching out to a new audience in the local community was at the core of this street-art action in Savamala. The Guerilla team left messages to residents and passers-by in a simple way, through a series of small interventions, in order to motivate them to pay special attention to the less beautiful things, neglected parts, and imperfections they may regularly encounter in Savamala. Shedding new light on their everyday environment made them think and see their neighborhood in a different way, finding beauty and potential in the aforementioned imperfections. Simply put, “street-art Savamala” was a transfer of the Guerilla spirit to the local community. During the interventions, we exclusively used non-invasive and environmental friendly material."
