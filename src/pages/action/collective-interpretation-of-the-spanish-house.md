  description: "The project ,,Collective interpretation of the Spanish house” aimed to make a series of collaborative activities and workshops together with Savamala residents, local initiatives, organizations and individuals, facilitate the use and breathe a new life into this abandoned object and make it a place of community gatherings. The Spanish house is a worn-out building symbolizing the process of the city and society deterioration. This former customhouse, now an object without a roof and almost a hotel-to-be, was given the Urban Incubator association for use in 2013. The specificity of this space are unresolved property relations: it is not a public space, but it could become one if the community and various initiatives are encouraged to join forces with an aim of reaching this mutual goal. The role of the School of Urban Practices was to connect all the parties and by working with them, generate a high quality program design to meet the needs of all the groups and individuals active in this particular space.\nThe objective of this project was to reach a consensus about a preliminary program of the house and common solutions regarding function and space design by connecting all interested parties and encouraging their mutual interaction, and to, according to programs and activities they suggest, make this space used again, open for the Savamala community and maintained together with the community.\nThe School of Urban Practices used its experience in the field of design to strengthen and support ideas and programs taking place in the Spanish house throughout 2015. Primarily through mediation and direct work with the community and various initiatives, as well as through a series of workshops and public meetings held in the Spanish house, we developed a strategy for the common program and spatial sustainability of this space.\n\nA total of 17 different public events took place in the Spanish house as a part of this project:\n1. Spanish House Project:: coaction 1 :: fresh&clean was an action of cleaning the Spanish House space together which included the entire City Guerilla team and Savamala neighbors.\n2.
