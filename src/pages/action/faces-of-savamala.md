  description: "Who are the people of Savamala? By looking at others, the Guerilla team also investigated their own identity in Savamala. A series of photographs with portraits of both residents and passers-by presented different faces of Savamala.\nThis idea was carried out in two steps. The first included taking portraits of random passers-by, while the second regarded portraits of Savamala residents in their homes, yards, and with photos they deemed precious. In that way, through faces of numerous individuals, a face of this neighborhood was created."
