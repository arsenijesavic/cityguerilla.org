description: >-
  Who is the artist in the 21st century? What makes his identity today and what
  role does he play? In what ways can it survive in today's economy? And to what
  extent is the community important and how to cooperate outside the borders?


  DACIDA is a fully online conference, developed via livestream, from Oct
  27-29th 2017.


  The DACIDA conference has been trying to raise key issues that accompany the
  life and identity of artists today, highlighting the importance of new
  technologies and their many possibilities.


  Through the conference program, which was divided into 3 thematic units
  (Aesthesis, Mimesis, Poiesis), we tried to carry you through important topics
  and segments that relate to the existence and life of artists today.


  The conference was completely free and could be followed via live-stream on
  the DACIDA YouTube channel and website.
