  description: "Savamala Imaginarium is the main project of the Savamala Walks module. Its predecessors are audio-guides conducted in Stuttgart in 2012 and in Belgrade (Savamala) in 2014. Both of them touch upon the imaginary sides of cities, the first regarding audiovisual and spatial side of Stuttgart, the second pertaining to overlapping historical and present aspects of Savamala. The idea further developed into creating alternative and creative guides to Savamala.\nThe module members agreed upon creating a printed medium which would represent both real and imaginary Savamala (and inevitably their combination). The said medium was manifested in form of unique interactive postcards, each one of them relating its own story.\nOne set of postcards, entitled Savamala monsters, presented seven imaginary creatures living in Savamala and posing their influence on it. Essentially, the idea of this set of postcards was to emphasize peculiarities and problems of Savamala by using imaginary perspective: the Savamala buildings are not worn out due to negligence, but due to a facadeater (an aptly named imaginary vermin) devouring its facades; the Spanish house is without roof not because an investor took it out but due to Sa-vamala tiles having been exterminated by their natural enemies, Savamala bricksters. This set of postcards later developed into an independent project of Savamala Walks.\nThe other set of postcards, entitled Savamala windows and doors, regarded doors and windows of various Savamala buildings, often inconspicuous to passers-by and yet for various reasons historically significant. The aim of this set was to show the historical importance of such buildings and their forgotten residents who used to be of great importance to Savamala, and sometimes even to the whole country.\nOther postcards were also in a similar vein, mixing the past and the present, presenting the problems and historical significance of Savamala.\nThe objectives of Savamala Imaginarium were, generally speaking: presenting Savamala’s history and pinpointing its problems through a creative medium and maintaining collaborative spirit through artistic projects."
