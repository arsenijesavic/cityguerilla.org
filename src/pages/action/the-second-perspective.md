  description: "Trying to get to know and experience Savamala in all its diversity and various facets, the Guerilla team decided to change the usual way this environment was percieved. A change in perspective was often accompanied by a change in the way of thinking. This resulted in a series of photographs depicting a play with light, reflection, shapes and motifs — valuable details otherwise unnoticeable unless you pay particular attention to them, including Savamala seen from the frog’s perspective and from the rarely visited corners."
