  description: "Freilautzeichnen (“free loud drawing”) is a sort of entry into the world of sounds by means of a regular pen. By applying a special combination of drawing techniques and sound recording, Goethe-Guerilla members recorded daily rhythms of Belgrade during a week-long workshop (12.-17.10.2010) with German artist Thorsten Streichardt. After the workshop ended, its results were shown from 18th to 25th october 2010 at the exhibition at the Goethe-Institute. At the Freilautzeichnen exhibition, the audience was given an opportunity to participate in the creative process by either creating sounds by drawing or drawing sounds with a pencil. It also had a chance to listen to the works produced in the workshop and participate in live discussion with this Berlin artist."
