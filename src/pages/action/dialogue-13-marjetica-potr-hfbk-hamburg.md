  description: "City Guerilla invites you to CG Dialogues with Marjetica Potrč, an artist and architect based in Ljubljana and Berlin. She will tell us a story about The Soweto Project (2014), and we will tell her a story about what was going on in Savamala - in the meantime.\n*****\nThe Soweto Project\n2014\nNine Urban Biotopes – Negotiating the Future of Urban Living Noordgesig and Orlando East, Soweto, South Africa\nProject by Marjetica Potrč and class Design for the Living World, HFBK Hamburg\nSupported by: The Culture Programme of the European Union and HFBK Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg\n***\nhttps://designforthelivingworld.com/2013/04/15/soweto-the-soweto-project/\nA publication The Soweto Project was published at the Archive Books in Berlin\n******\nThe Soweto Project developed over the course of two months in early 2014 at two locations in Soweto – Orlando East and Noordgesig. In Orlando East, the local residents and we turned a former public space that had been used as a dumping ground into a community-organized public space called Ubuntu Park. We build a stage, braai-stands (BBQ-stands), and tables and benches together. The project engages community using relational objects and performative actions, such as the construction of a performance platform and the organization of a Soweto Street Festival. In all these endeavors, we followed the principles of participatory design:\nListening to and talking with the local residents before making any definite plan.\nInvolving the community in the decision-making and design processes.\nInvolving the community in the construction process.\nTransferring responsibility for the developed project to the community in order to leave behind a sustainable work that benefits population in the long term.\nPhoto above: Ubuntu Park\n\n******\n\nSince 2011, Marjetica Potrč has been a professor at the \nUniversity of Fine Arts/HFBK in Hamburg. She has also been a visiting professor at a number of other institutions, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2005) and the IUAV Faculty of Arts and Design in Venice (2008, 2010).\nPotrč has received numerous awards, including grants from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation (1993, 1999); the Hugo Boss Prize 2000, administered by the Guggenheim Museum; a Caracas Case Project Fellowship from the Federal Cultural Foundation, Germany, and the Caracas Urban Think Tank, Venezuela (2002); and the Vera List Center for Arts and Politics Fellowship at The New School in New York (2007).\nThree years ago (2013) Marjetica and Design for the living world took part in Urban Incubator project in Belgrade, with their project: Savamaal - a place for making:\nhttps://designforthelivingworld.com/2013/04/10/savamala-a-place-for-making/"
