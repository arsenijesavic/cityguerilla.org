  location: "Belgrade"
  description: "None of the public toilets in Belgrade are open 24 hours a day. This of course applies only to „official“ public toilets. Besides them, there are well-known „unofficial versions“ (such as eaves, dark corners in parks etc.).\nThe aim of the project was to use creative means such as drawings, posters, photos on a foil, ecological graffiti made of moss and the like, to mark “unofficial public toilets” thus turning the attention of the citizens to this problem and initiating a discussion about the city’s lack of public toilets and their inadequate working hours."
