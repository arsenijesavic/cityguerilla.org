Blok 74 is dedicated to creating new intelligence about public spaces, using advanced spatial analytics, communication and interactivity.\"\n...\n\nIAAU:\n\n\"In order to make the creative energy and cultural patterns of the self-organisation visible, the project uses four key-perspectives (The Initiator, the Artist, his Advocate, and the Urbanist) to determine a course of action.\""
