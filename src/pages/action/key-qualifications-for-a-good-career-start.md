  description: "Panel discussion entitled “Key qualifications for a good career start and the role of the German language”, answered practical questions raised by many senior undergraduates and young people starting their careers. On Thursday, 17 June 2010, in the Goethe-Institut, a dynamic discussion was held which showed that the young were highly motivated to look for jobs and find mechanisms to work during their studies despite different social and economic challenges. This discussion was attended by roughly hundred, mostly college-educated and young people which proved there is a big interest for manifestations of this type.\nThe event was realized in cooperation with the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce, the Centre for Career Development and Student Counseling, the German Development Agency GTZ, the German Agency for Employment DEKRA and the Centre for Human Resources Development and Management - MNG Center."
