  description: "„Tram 2 route through time and fashion“ is a project by City Guerilla whose initial idea was to evoke the spirit old Belgrade. Hence, two motifs which are most associated with it were chosen as its symbols –\nvintage clothing and the tram 2 route. The project consisted of three segments:\n1. Research, second hand shop tours through Belgrade and Germany as well as documentation production in the form of postcards\n2. Gathering of clothing and photos of the favorite retro-style clothing through an on-line call.\n3. 31 May 2010 – realization of the project “Tram 2 route through time and fashion” which comprised a traveling exhibition, exchange of clothes and a mini sax & guitar concert inside the number 2 tram. \nThe idea behind this project aside from the photo exhibition and musical show, was to initiate a free exchange of things within the number 2 tram: clothes, books, cassettes, records and everyday objects. In this way, the Guerilla team encouraged people to reminisce about past times and the old Belgrade in a creative way, all the while offering people an enjoyable tram ride during which they could distance themselves from everyday worries and meet the more intimate history of our capital city."
