  description: "City Guerilla in cooperation with KC GRAD invites you to Dialogues *special edition* / Alternative Futures: Istanbul talks in which prominent artists, agencies, engineers, designers and creative industry actors of Istanbul, such as curator and Media Teorist Asoc. Prof. Ebru Yetiskin from Istanbul Technical University, multidisciplinary artists Gizem Renklidag and Pinar Akkurt, co-founder and director Candas Sisman from NOHlab, sound artist and composer Alican Okan from Audiofil, project manager Doğuş Dilbaz from Nerdworking and co-founder and production manager Cihan Cankaya from DECOL, will share their recent works and perspectives.\n \nWhile predicting the future is an eternal pursuit, rendering it experiential is a more modern innovation. Indeed, “The World of Tomorrow,” echoes back from the 1939 World’s Fair.\n \nToday art works, projects, products and ideas related with the design of alternative futures shapes our expectations of technology, politics and society in decades to come by demonstrating us what that emerging world might appear as well.\n \nAlternative future ideas are made real in the form of interactive exhibitions, product demonstrations, and behind-the-scenes consulting work.\n \nBut some critical questions seem to remain:\n \nHow can we make alternative futures by not reproducing the future propaganda for corporations and governments?\nHow can we flee from the mainstream futuristic aesthetic and create alternative modes of existence?"
