  description: "Stammtisch (regulars’ table) is a compound word coming from the German words stamm – regular and Tisch – table. As the name itself says, this kind of table gathers people who regularly meet at one place and in regular time intervals discuss about topics of their common interest. The GG´s “Stammtischˮ was no exception: it was a monthly gathering of people interested in German culture and language. Conversations were usually led in German and Serbian. The topics were truly miscellaneous, and the aim of such meetings was, above all, enjoying good company and creating a good atmosphere. During 2011 and 2012 a dozen of these meeting were held in different locations such as the jazz café “Čekaonica” in the BIGZ building, cafés “Lejla” and “Fidel” in Dorćol."
