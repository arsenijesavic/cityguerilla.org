  description: "The story of the performance \"The Other Side of Normality\" follows the universal artist, the composer who creates the opera, and at the same time tries to break out with the psychotic crisis through which it passes. Is it possible to articulate at the moment or is it perhaps the solution?\n\nThe performance deals with the issue of creating and artistic expression of people with mental problems. It was realized in cooperation with Prostor within the program, which organizes an art therapy group intended for psychiatric services users and in cooperation with the City Gehren, with the support of the Goethe-Institut.\n\nPerformance is a unique blend of drama forms with opera and modern ballet with video mapping that shapes the story.\n\n\"The Other Side of Normality\" was performed by a pilot project that he performed at the Take Over Festival in November 2016 at Kolarac.\n\nArtist: Željko Maksimović\nSinger: Marko Pantelić\nPianist: Sara Mandic\nBalerin: Andrea Dobric and Ana Gliksman\nQueen of the Night (voice): Vaja Dujovic\n\nText: Nina Jouver\nDirector: Isidora Goncić\nAssistant Director: Marko Čelabić\nArrangement: Miloš Jovanović\nSound Design: Ivan Kole Branisavljević\nVisual Identity: Djordje Mojsilovic\nVideo mapping: Arsenije Savić\n\nThe program:\nMagic Fluff, W.
