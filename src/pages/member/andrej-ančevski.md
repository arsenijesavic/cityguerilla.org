  bio: "During the day I’m a 23-year-old telecommunication student and engineering geek, by night a sound artist and electronic musician. I dream about changing reality and filling its potential for the extraordinary. I shape new technology as an extension of humanity. Besides that I like to spend my time watching plants grow."
