  bio: "I was born in Belgrade, where I grew up. I went to school there, and I did that a bit in some other countries as well. I have been writing since high school, and in the last few years I have been part of the music magazine “Nocturne”. By working there I merged my love of music and writing, so spending time with earphones in my ears now has a multiple role. Although I am a graduate economist, I am turned to culture, art and working with children through various activities, so I still walk different paths looking for the one that will become my way. Through the work with Goethe-Guerilla, I will try to connect my love to Belgrade with the benefit it can have from our creativity and ideas, in order to eventually incorporate a part of us into its appearance and identity."
