  bio: "My name is Dardanie Pajaziti and I was born on 7 May 1990 in Prishtina. I have lived for 10 years with my family in North Rhine-Westphalia where I also finished elementary school. Since I were a child i was interested in art and creativity and had my own program for youngsters on the radio. Now I am at the end of my German language and literature studies. I hope that I will finish it successfully."
