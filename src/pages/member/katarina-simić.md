  bio: "Let’s try it this way: slow and quick, moderate and sudden, thoughtful and hasty, cold and warm, closed and open, calm and vigorous, soft and rough, precision and confusion, city’s chaos and nature’s peace. Various contrasts and the diversity of the world is what makes me and attracts me. I love and I am happy to let the currents of life and time lead me. Music to get lost in it, the light of the day and the pure sky to find yourself there, the laughter of stranger and the dear ones to remind you of the happiness of life - that's enough for me. Elan, strength, curiosity, and constant desire move me, and giving up is out of question."
