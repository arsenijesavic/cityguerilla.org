  bio: "A salute to all men of good will! My name is Danilo, I live in Belgrade and study economics. My wish is to bring my linguistic skills to perfection and to travel around our planet to extend my horizon. I am interested in sociology and the human psyche. Because I have many obligations, I like to spend my spare time with nice and dear people somewhere far away from the tumult of the city. Daily routine can be terrible, so I try to enrich it."
