  bio: "Dragana Žarevac is a visual artist who has traveled the world alone or with her works. She has a son who is interested in sociological theories, and she is ever more interested in showing people who haven’t yet gained much knowledge and experience how they can achieve it. Knowledge and love can be shared boundlessly, but they always remain ours."
