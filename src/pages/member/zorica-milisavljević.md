  bio: "She started her studies at Kunsthochschule Weissensee and stayed there until the fall of the Berlin wall, later graduating from the Faculty of Applied Arts and Design in Belgrade when first \"walls\" were erected on the borders which appeared after the dismemberment of Yugoslavia, the country in which she was born. In the following years she developed a passion for exploring creative forms which make art an efficient weapon against the omnipresent walls of everyday life, first that of war and revolution, and later the one stirred up by continuous changes in a society torn between the memories of the golden age of the Yugoslav past and a dream of better future which is still far away.\nShe is engaged in graphic design, translation, writing, and is on an ongoing quest for knowledge in various fields. She has been working at the cultural program department of Goethe-Institut in Belgrade for twenty years. She is one of the founders of the Goethe-Guerilla project (whose mentor she has been since 2010) and later a co-founder of the City Guerilla association (founded in 2014) which stems from the former. Within these groups she has been devoted to examining the possibilities of establishing creative synergy through a self-organized group of young people of different interests, educational backgrounds, different age and different experiences. She is also interested in the processes that include the variability of the compatibility rhythm, functionality and sustainability of such a group and its impact on the urban environment in which it was formed. By playing a non-hierarchical role, i.e. being an observer, advisor and mentor, in the last eight years she has been working side by side with over two hundred young people from Belgrade as well as from 10 European cities where this model of youth self-organization in urban environments has been tested as part of the Goethe-Guerilla Project."
