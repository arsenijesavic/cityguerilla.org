  bio: "a.k.a. micikitis\nFreelance photographer and graphic designer (from June a certificated restorer of paper artworks). Using different media she ties together history, the forgotten and the exotic. She likes the smell of old books, coffee and forgotten photo albums from the attic. Won the first prize for her poster “Sport, Science, Art” and the 2nd prize for photography at Fenix Art Festival. Up until now she has brewed two single exhibitions and has been involved in more than twenty communal exhibitions and painter’s colonies as well as some other socially (un)useful gustations ;-)"
