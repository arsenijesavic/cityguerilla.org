  bio: "My name is Goran Milojević, I live in Herceg Novi and I am member of the Sinestezija Festival team, Eko fest, a volunteer for the Red Cross, and the Herceg Novi theater member. I play the trumpet in „Gradska muzika Herceg Novi“ orchestra and I am also a member of a local band. I like music and street art. I am already glad in advance because I hope that I will gain new experiences and get to know many different and interesting people. I love to improvise and create."
