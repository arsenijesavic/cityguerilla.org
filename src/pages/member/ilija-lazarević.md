  bio: "I study graphic design at the Faculty of Applied Arts in Belgrade. To celebrate the fifteenth birthday of my social engagement I became a member of Goethe guerrilla. When I joined a boy scouts group in 1996, we didn’t call that engagement. Only when we got older, we started naming things and up until then we simply did them and I still like this more. As my social engagement is in the zenith of its puberty, I expect that my behavior and my energy in the Guerilla will conform to it. I’m interested in the phenomenon of the creation to which, in my opinion, the best access is the informal one."
