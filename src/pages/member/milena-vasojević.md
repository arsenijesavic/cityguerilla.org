  bio: "You know when we were kids, and someone came to your door completely uninvited to call you to play? I am one of these advocates of unexpectedness, illogicality and constant curiosity. One of those who run away, and don’t know where they will go, who runs all around and casts a glance wherever they can, who stops, surprised, until he feels or understands, and with that joyfully continues on and on and on. Beside that, I'm asking a lot and I'm wonder a lot."
