  bio: "My name is Andrija. I am 25 years old, born in Belgrade. I study Theater, Broadcast and Culture Production Management at the University of Arts in Belgrade. Recently, I sometimes think it would be better if I had become a football player. In close future I plan to join a political party. If you ask me what I like more, ajvar or caviar, I will always answer „caviar“, even though I’ve maybe never tried it."
