  bio: "My name is Andreas Michalovcik and am half a mixture of Serbian, Costa Rican, Spaniard and Slovak. The other half is a German who tries to learn at least so much Serbian that he can order a pljeskavica easily. Iâ€™m quite a decent tennis player, I like dancing and think that the Church of St. Sava is much more beautiful than Sagrada Familia. Especially at night."
