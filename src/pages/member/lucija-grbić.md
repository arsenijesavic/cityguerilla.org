  bio: "In my 24 years, I’ve dealt with a lot of things, but I still find new ones again and again. I’m searching for innovative solutions, for something inspiring, something I consider beautiful; or I just create my own something with my fantasy, and transfer it to reality with a pen or a brush, or by using photography. In my circle of friends I am the initiator and organizer of common activities. I am often in rush, but still I love this hectic rush. I love to discover new places, so I often wonder around, always accompanied by music. I exclude myself a bit from the world. As I love traveling so much, the fact that I probably won’t see every place that I want to see, is making me sad. But I defy this by traveling a lot."
