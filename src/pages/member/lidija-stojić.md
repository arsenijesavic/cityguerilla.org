  bio: "s04e15 - Student of German studies (21) steps into the Savamala area to find out whether the Spanish house will get a roof, the steamboat “Zupa” sink for the third time and the roundabout succeed in confusing the drivers. In the meantime, she will try to catch a few pondering passer-by faces with the camera. Radiohead is the soundtrack of her life, and its narrator Mr. Hesse. General sponsor: freshly brewed coffee."
