  bio: "I am 24 years old and study at two faculties - Law and German language and literature. I’m full of love and the joys of life. However, I can be quite headstrong and ambitious if I want to have something or if it is about my aims and education.\nThis slogan has often accompanied me in my life: “Never regret what you have done if you were happy at the moment you did it.“"
