  bio: "My name is Tamara, I was born in a mysterious city. Its face is known to everybody and its name is Belgrade. I’m still learning about his secrets and becoming part of those mysteries he gives us. I love the strange paths through which our life leads us, so I'm currently volunteering at Hippodrome. I like to travel, my wish is to visit the vast areas of our planet, and to draw them in my small notebook so that I can always carry them with me. Imagine that happiness when you wake up with your thoughts: what is waiting for me behind that hill? What beauty will I see today?"
