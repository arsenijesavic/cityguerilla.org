  bio: "“It's leviOsa, not leviosaaa” - Hermione Granger. According to some claims, I'm acting as if I accidentally got off the train to Hogwarts. I am trying to comfort myself with the fact that the Serbian post might have lost my letter, and that's why, instead of Hogwarts, I ended up as an artist, doing graphics and illustration. I like animals, especially dogs, and among arthropods I appreciate the spiders. I have a dog called Evgenije and Djuro - a subtenant and we all share the living space successfully."
