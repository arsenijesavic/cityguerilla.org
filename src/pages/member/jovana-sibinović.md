  bio: "Jovana Sibinović, visual artist, student of painting at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Belgrade, to whom painting as art is more important than painting process itself. In the service of her inner guide, she observes the world with all her attention, especially people and their faces. She is persistently trying to create something special from something ordinary. She is interested in art from decaying materials, whose characteristic is transience and shortness. She still does not know whether painting was, after all, her choice, or it just happened so."
