  bio: "She was born in Zagreb, lived in Glina, then came to Belgrade. She enrolled in Sculpture, because she can’t live without clay. She doesn’t like everything that young people like, but she’s still young. She is 26, but would like to be 16. She dreams about traveling the whole world. She loves all kinds of heavy metal music, but also likes people who hate her choice of music. She likes Germany. She likes dogs. She doesn’t like knives."
