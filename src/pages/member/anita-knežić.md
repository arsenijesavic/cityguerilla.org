  bio: "My name is Anita. I study architecture which I love and which inspires me. I love Belgrade because its advantages and disadvantages make it special and wonderful. I wish to be a part of the future Belgrade which will probably be even more beautiful than it is now. The small things are giving me joy in life. A well-made photo, a good book, an unfulfilled dream, a film, music, light, shade, the smell of rain or a sketch on the last page - and just a regular day becomes a miraculous adventure."
