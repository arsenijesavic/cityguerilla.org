  bio: "A seemingly simple thing turned out to be very complicated - describing yourself in two, three lines. The first line is easy! My name is Dajana, born in Sarajevo, I live in Belgrade and I'm a third year student at the Faculty of Security. I'm not going any further, because I would like to fill in the remaining two lines yourself. That's easy - let's meet!"
