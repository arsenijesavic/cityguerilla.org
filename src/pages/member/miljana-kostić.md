  bio: "Citizens of Belgrade have, like most people, a thrilling and stressful everyday life and, apart from that, too little spare time. If you add a German language and literature study to that you’ll get a general description of me. I am somebody who always sees the half-full glass and tries to get to know her surroundings from a different, unusual point of view. Furthermore, I think it’s important that one always stays curious. Exactly this attitude is what I want to convey to my future pupils. When I’m not dreaming about my small linguistic school in Brazil - my absolute favorite country - the likelihood is huge that I either read or write. Moreover, I like philosophy, literature, dancing and the Portuguese language. Like Socrates said: one can only know, that one knows nothing."
