  bio: "Student of the last year of Music science at the Faculty for Music. When I grow up, I will be conductor, music producer, composer for film and theater soundtrack, jazz pianist, jazz saxophonist and photographer. My favorite sound: tuning of the symphony orchestra before the conductor comes. Together with my fellow students I exert myself for editing and systematization of the data bank for national history of music."
