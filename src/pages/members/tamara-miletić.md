  bio: "I’m interested in architecture and all forms of art. I like to draw, read, explore, conceive, make. I think that creativity in people is an invaluable gift that needs to be nourished and applied in different aspects of life. I like to be active, I’m engaged in physical activity - running, swimming, recreational bicycle pedaling, pilates, dancing, jumping. I love to rest as well."
