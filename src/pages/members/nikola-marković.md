  bio: "I was born and raised in Belgrade. Thanks to the bad school system I was forced to peek into the library, which had quickly become my only true teacher. Rebel by personal inclination, I would make jokes out of every situation, more often on my own account than to that of the others. Hard living conditions in Serbia force me to mature faster and awoke the wish to create and change something in my passive environment. the spirit of adventure and the desire to know more led me to enroll into tourism studies. If I’m not in nature with my huge backpack or cycling, then I’m wielding a sword, go to movies or read Mark Twain."
