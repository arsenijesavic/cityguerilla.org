  bio: "I am a man, a woman, a child and an old man. I am an animal. I am earth, air, water and fire. But who isn’t all of that? I think and feel. Inseparably. I am a person and an artist. Designer, painter, sculptor, artisan, costume designer, try myself as a tailor, I am a gardener, cook, heater in winter, author, player, bad singer, traveler, photographer, actress, director, spectator and listener. Art is everywhere. It is a necessity. She breaks out of all and doesn’t let you go. She doesn’t let you rest. She is noble and relentless, easy and complicated, it’s like you fall silent and nevertheless do not stop to speak. I wish, I could convey this feeling to everyone."
