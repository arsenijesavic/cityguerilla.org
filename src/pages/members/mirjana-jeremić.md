  bio: "I am interested in countless things. Perhaps in too many, I don’t know. I am often unrealistic when it comes to wishes and ideas, but I think that's good. Somewhat by chance, I became a student of architecture and in a few months I will become a Master of architecture, which is just a new name for a graduate engineer. What it really means - I don’t know, but I can’t wait to see."
