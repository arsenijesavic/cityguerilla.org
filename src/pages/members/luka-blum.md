  bio: "I was born in Berlin and now live in Belgrade. This divides and defines me. I carry Berlin through the constant play between the old and the new in me and Belgrade through my special openness to people. I study at the Faculty of Philology, I like photography, music, traveling and I am glad about every invitation that I get."
