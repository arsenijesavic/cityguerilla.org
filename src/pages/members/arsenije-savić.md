  bio: "In a wider sense, heresy, in a narrower a bluffer. Don’t try to bluff a bluffer. Never! Life in art, stars in sound. He started as a young DJ and ended up as a sound engineer, under the slogan \"a DJ Changed My Life\". It's like I was from Bohemia, but I'm actually a genie in the lamp. So when you need peace, I am a persona non grata (unnumbered cattle, google translation note). If life is a stage, I'm here to steal your show. There’s not a single road, only more bypasses. The bigger they are, the harder they fall. It doesn’t matter what you see, but what you don’t. Greetings from Mars."
