  bio: "All children, except one, grow up. Don’t worry, Peter, you're not the only one. From all sides they are rushing you to grow up, graduate, find a job, marry, retire... If I could, I would like to press a pause for a while with these twenty-four years of mine, and not to think about that unavoidable growing-up. And if such destiny can’t be avoided, then at least I can try to save that child spark that makes life ever more colorful, valuable, more magical. In the meantime, I will draw, write, travel, doodle, sing, play a little, and finally, finish my Master’s in English. By the way, who is going to sew back this shadow that came off my shoe sole?"
