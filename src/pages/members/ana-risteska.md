  bio: "I was born and live in Skopje and I am a certified informatics engineer. I am curious about the questions regarding the bond between aesthetics and information, between intuitiveness and essence, visual composition and technical functionality and its implementation in everyday life. Therefore, the focus of my professional development was logically directed towards web-design. I like to investigate the development of interactive interfaces, usage of new media in realization of artistic ideas, and to walk on the wire connecting science, technology and art. In my spare time I train fencing, meet friends, cook, draw and read."
