  bio: "I was born and raised in Belgrade. There I also graduated at the Faculty of Philology, at the department of German studies: the German language and literature. I like every season of the year, sand and volleyball. I read, travel and listen to my inner self and that of the other. I enjoy sociability, but also respect silence. I am a wine-lover and gourmet. The roasted pumpkin reminds me of the smell of my home which I love above all. When you play, the whole life passes with shoes and paintbrushes, collective pictures and toys, words and sleighs and of course with dear people."
