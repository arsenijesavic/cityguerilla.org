  bio: "Mirjana Utvić (1989) is a young architect who lives and works in Belgrade, Serbia. Her projects aim to empower society and improve the environment through innovative design and practice, by creating spaces for encounters, exchange and experiment. At the beginning of 2011 she joined Goethe-Guerilla group (now City Guerilla) where she has, together with the group, developed a series of interdisciplinary projects, workshops and actions. From 2012, she has been active in participatory research projects within the School of Urban Practices in Belgrade (My piece of Savamala, C5, Urban Cooks), where she is one of the mentors and coordinators. In 2014, she participated in a pilot residential program, “Create in Residence” in Sweden.
