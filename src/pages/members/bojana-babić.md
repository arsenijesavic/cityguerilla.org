  bio: "I was born in Pančevo some years ago. Now I divide my weekends  (un)successfully between my hometown, where I live, and Belgrade, where I study dramaturgy and sometimes live. I believe in storytelling, engaged art and I Ching. In my free time I travel, I eavesdrop on people’s conversations and feed dogs and cats on the streets."
