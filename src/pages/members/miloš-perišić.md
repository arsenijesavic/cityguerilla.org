  bio: "Born on the Bastille day/ To be free to the bone is my milieu. / To be yourself, be special, don’t know if everyone can do that/ But I nurture what I am, ‘cause you can’t jump out of your skin./ As myself I let the others be what they are/ Who is open-minded and of free spirit, that knows my address./ To be ‘crazy’ and dream your dreams is the brightest thing, / But happy is the one who leaves a couple of smiles behind.\nI am interested in music and photography, I study at the Faculty of Philology at the Department of Literature."
